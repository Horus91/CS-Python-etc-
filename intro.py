# ------------------------------------------------CONTROL FLOW
# Boolean expresions are expression wich can be evaluated
# with True or False these last ones are boolean variables
# relational operators are == || != (Compare two items and return True or False)

# boolean types are fundamental for building conditional statements
# Example of a controlflow

# relational operators are > >= < <=
# Boolean operators are 'and' 'or' 'not' last operator reverses boolean value
# ------------------------------------------------ERRORS
# Syntax Error: means there is something wrong the way your program is written
# mostly misspelling keyword, paranthesis , semicolumns etc...
# Name Error: common error is misspelling or forgetting ...
# Type Error: the attempts to use an operator on something of the incorrect type
# Logic errors: Errors found by the programmer when the program isnâ€™t doing
# what it is intending to do.
# ------------------------------------------------LISTS AND TUPLES
# lists in python can store every variable type
# lists Methods

# lists can be concatenated with + however it has to be a list also
# there are so many useful methods for the lists .insert();.pop();.remove()
# .count();.append();.clear();.index();.sort() etc..
# the function range() is important it is used to create series of succeding numbers
# len() is used to measure the length of a list
# we can slice a list by assigning it to a variable likewise 'l2=l1[1:4]' l1 is a list bear in mind index 4 isn't included
# slicing can even be done likewise [:n] or [-n:] or [:-n]
# .sort() used in a descending order can be used in ascending with the parameter (reverse=True)
# sorted(l1) can assign the sorted "l1" to a new list with sorted order unlike .sort() wich returns no value
# tupples are lists but they're "immutable" can't be changed reassigned
# tup1=("Nabil",31,"pilot") how ever you can attribute tupple values to variables likewise
# name,age,work=tup1 to create a one element tupple you have to put trailing comma tup2=(5,)
# we can join two lists in one with the following method zip(l1,l2) values will be joined as a tupple and
# the variable storing the zip has to be converted to a list with the following method .list(l3)
# ------------------------------------------------LOOPS
# this is an example of a foor loop
# for <temporary variable> in <collection>:
#   <action>
# you ought to make  your temporary variable descriptive to distinguish it from other variables
# While loop needs a variable and it is required to get iterated
# while <conditional statement>:
#   <action>

# break and continue are useful tools to control a loop they're usually paired with if/elif/else statements
# nested loops are required in certain situations lists inside  lists or whatever

# Example
# scaled_grades = [grade + 10 if grade > 70 else grade for grade in grades]
# is the same as
# scaled_grades = []
# for grade in grades:
#     scaled_grades.append(grade + 10)

# ------------------------------------------------FUNCTIONS
# Functions are a convenient way to group our code into reusable blocks.
# we can define a function likewise
# def foo():
#     <actions>
# functions admits parameters they should be stated in the paranthesis following the header
# there are 3 types of arguments (positional,keyword,default)
# positional parameters values should be called in order
# keyword parameters values can be called using the keyword ex

# def foo(x, y, z=1): # z is a default argument set to 1 we can omit giving value to z if calling foo
#     print(x/y)


# foo(y=1, x=2) #These are keywords arguments
# there are a lot of built-in python functions check them on the documentation for more
# info for example there is max();min();round(); print(); len() etc....
# to make a function useful it has to return a value we can return several values by separating them
# with commas example: return a,b,c
# def top_tourist_locations_italy():
#     first = "Rome"
#     second = "Venice"
#     third = "Florence"
#     return first, second, third


# top_tourist_locations_italy() = most_popular1, most_popular2, most_popular3
# print(most_popular1)

# ------------------------------------------------SCOPE
# The scope of our data(Variables etc....) is the level at which it can be accessed.
# Global scope means declaring a variable that can be accessed in the whole Program
# Local scope means the variables that are found within a function
